              <h2>biography</h2>
              <p>
                Kobe Bean Bryant was an American professional basketball player.
                As a shooting guard, Bryant entered the National Basketball
                Association (NBA) directly from high school, and played his
                entire 20-season professional career in the league with the Los
                Angeles Lakers. Bryant was the son of former NBA player Joe
                Bryant.
              </p>
              <p>
                He attended Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania, where he
                was recognized as the top high-school basketball player in the
                country. Bryant is the all-time leading scorer in Lakers
                franchise history. He was also the first guard in NBA history to
                play at least 20 seasons. He gave himself the nickname "Black
                Mamba" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted
                by the general public.

              <h3>NBA Draft</h3>
              <p>
                Kobe Bryant was drafted as the 13th overall pick by Charlotte
                Hornets in the NBA Draft. Soon, traded to the Los Angeles
                Lakers. Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high
                school.“For someone that age, it was remarkable, the skill and
                love he had for the game along with desire to excel. I never had
                seen anyone with the skill level he had.”, Jerry West said of
                Kobe Bryant commenting on his pre-draft workout.

              <p>
                Phil Jackson took over as coach of the Lakers in 1999. The
                Lakers became championship contenders behind the center-guard
                combination of Bryant and O'Neal. Jackson utilized the triangle
                offense that he implemented to win six championships with the
                Chicago Bulls; this offense would help both Bryant and O'Neal
                rise to the elite class of the NBA. Three championships were won
                consecutively in 2000, 2001, and 2002, further cementing this
                view.

                Kobe Bryant burned the Toronto Raptors on January 22, 2006 in

                the Lakers scored a 122-104 comeback victory at home, Bryant
                finished with <b>81 points </b> on 28-of-46 shooting, including
                7-of-13 from 3-point range, and 18-of-20 from the foul line.

                championship and earned his second consecutive NBA Finals MVP
                award in the following year, 2010. Bryant said that this was the
                most satisfying of all of his five championships.
